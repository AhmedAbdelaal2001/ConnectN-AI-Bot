# ConnectN-AI-Bot
The first individual programming project, which I made in my freshman year.

This project uses MATLAB to build an extension of the famous connect 4 game, called connectN, in which the user can specify the number of adjacent pieces required for a win, as well as the dimensions of the board. The user can play against another human, or against an AI bot, which was built using the Minimax algorithm, with alpha-beta pruning.
